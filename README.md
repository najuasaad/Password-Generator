# Password Generator

When running properly, the function should prompt to ask for character length, then four more prompts on whether to approve the use of numberic, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.

If the improper number of characters is entered or none of the character types are chosen, it should throw an error and restart that process.

The length entered should tell an array how long it should run and the character type arrays should be available or unavailable to pull data from to include in the random password.
